## üöÄ Features

- **Custom & Default Lists**: Users can create lists and organize their tasks. A special "My Day" list displays tasks for the current day.
- **Real-time Task Sync**: Shared lists sync across users instantly using **Supabase Realtime & RLS**.
- **List Invitation & Access Control**:

  - Share lists with others through invitation links.
  - Remove users from shared lists.
  - Disable list sharing for users: This will restrict access to the list, allowing only the owner to view and modify it.
  - Disable invitation links: This prevents new users from being added to the shared list through invitation links.

- **Task Management**:
  - Star, mark as completed, and categorize tasks.
  - Add notes and subtasks (steps) to tasks.
  - Set reminders, due dates, and repeat rules.
- **Offline Support & Change Log Mechanism**:

  - If the connection drops, changes are logged and synced when reconnected.
  - Ensures data consistency even during network failures.

- **Task Reminder Alarm**: A pop-up alarm triggers when a task's time reminder is up, ensuring that users are notified instantly at the scheduled time.

- **Client-Side Optimizations**:

  - Uses **Zustand for state management**, stored in **Session Storage** to boost performance.
  - Prevents unnecessary database requests by only syncing relevant changes.

- **Error Collection & Future Fixes**: Collects all client-side errors and sends them to the database to be addressed and fixed in future versions.

- **Route Protection**: Implemented using middleware and Clerk, ensuring only authenticated users can access sensitive pages, protecting restricted areas of the app.

- **Task Search**: Enables searching between the user‚Äôs tasks and tasks shared with the user, making it easy to find and manage tasks across all lists.

- **Full Responsive & Mobile-First Design**:

  - Carefully crafted UI with pixel-perfect details.
  - **Framer Motion** is used for smooth transitions and modal animations, providing a soft and attractive user experience.
  - **Custom Color System**: A separate color scheme for each list component, ensuring unique visual identities.
  - **Themed Loading Spinner**: A loading spinner that aligns with the overall theme, ensuring all components feel integrated with the app's design.
  - **Custom Images**: Used for designing key pages like login, join invitations, and "My Day," adding visually appealing, intricate elements to the UI.

## üèÜ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Synchronization Issues**

- **Challenge**: Keeping tasks **consistently synced** between multiple users while avoiding race conditions.
- **Solution**: Used **Supabase Realtime + RPC functions** to ensure users always receive the latest data. If the real-time listener fails, an **RPC function is triggered on reload** to fetch the latest state.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Authorization (RLS & RPC)**

- **Challenge**: Preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Solution**: Implemented **Row Level Security (RLS) & RPC functions**, enforcing strict authentication and authorization checks **directly at the database level**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Offline Mode & Change Log**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring tasks are **not lost** when users go offline.
- **Solution**: Implemented a **Change Log Mechanism** that temporarily stores updates in **Session Storage** and syncs them when the connection is restored.

  - All changes are consolidated to optimize database writes and prevent unnecessary operations.
  - Multiple updates to the same task are batched into a single optimized request.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Task Recurrence & Reminder System**

- **Challenge**: Handling **due dates, repeat rules, and reminders** seamlessly.
- **Solution**: Built a **custom recurrence logic** and integrated a notification system that triggers reminders via **modal pop-ups**.

<br>

## üéØ Key Architectural Decisions

- **Next.js**: I chose that for its seamless integration of front-end and back-end development. With **(SSR)** and **Server Actions**, it allows efficient and secure client-database communication, simplifying the architecture and enabling rapid, scalable development for feature-rich, real-time applications.

- **Server Actions**: Server Actions serve as an intermediary, securely managing client-database communication and preventing direct client-to-database connections.

  - Enhanced Security
  - Control over Data Flow

- **Security, Authentication & Authorization**:

  - No Direct Client-Database Connection: All interactions are routed through Server Actions to enhance security and reliability.

  - Authentication & Authorization: Managed at the database level using RLS and RPC functions, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive data.

- **RPC Functions for Critical Updates**: Ensures **atomic database operations**, preventing inconsistent states and ensuring reliable data updates across the app.

- **Zustand for State Management**: State is stored in **Session Storage**, improving performance by persisting state and reducing unnecessary re-renders.
